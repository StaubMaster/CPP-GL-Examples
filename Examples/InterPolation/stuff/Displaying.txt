have a better way of displaying certain stuff

mainly thinking of Wire stuff
WireFrame
{
	Corners
	Indexes for Element Buffer
	draw Lines (2 Indexes pre Line)

	PolyHedra
	{
		make a line for each side of a triangle
		remove duplicates
		maybe have that as an extra functino ?
	}

	how to do Color ?
	one Color per Corner
}



Spline
	split Spline into segments (8 or so. probably base on distance ?)
	draw those lines

Control Points
	draw a Line for from Pos to Pos + Dir





Point		small Spheare
Direction	Arrow

these would be nice to have a constant size on screen ?
or maybe do scale them, but give them a minimum and maximum size on screen
the lines have constant thickness (1 Pixel) so having these be constant would be consistent

these might be easiest with geometry Shaders
for points, put a small square aroud the point
for arrows, put small lines at the end of the line

or

for Points, have a thing in the Main Buffer
then have the actual Point in the Inst Buffer
then calculate the distance from the View to the Point
and use that as scale

with Arrows
needs a Line, which is just a cylinder, scale that between the points
but how to do the head ?
just scale the whole thing ?
that might stretch a lot
