right now i have the Light Shader stuff, but only use it for the Light Example
the rest use a FullBright Shader
but FullBright can be done with the Light Shader



use the Light Shader for everything
but then the Light stuff needs Setup

make another "Manager" for that stuff
make a seperate one for just the Light stuff ?
or add this stuff to the PolyHedra Manager ?



also having the UI Stuff together might me nice as well ?



also I dont like how setting Shader Files works currently



PolyHedra Single Manager	rename to	PolyHedra Simple3D Instances
PolyHedra Multi Manager		rename to	PolyHedra Simple3D Manager
