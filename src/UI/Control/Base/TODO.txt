some things are ugly



	Setting Anchors
only set the information needed for that Anchor

	Themes
right now each control sets its default stuff in the Constructor
organize into themes ?





	Color/Texture/Display-State
Enabled, not Selected, not Hovering
Enabled, not Selected, Hovering
Enabled, Selected, not Hovering
Enabled, Selected, Hovering
Disabled

Toggle needs State Colors
maybe instead of Toggle, make it loop between different states ?
maybe left click goes foreward and right goes backward







	Cursor
change Cursor when hovering Controls







	Internal and External funcitons

Internal Functions
stuff like Resize, which get called automatically to change Anchor and such

External Functions
functions Pointers for User defined functinos, like when something resizes

together this would clutter up the class ?

put them in a nested class
	still have them in the Base but private ?

what functions do I need ?
