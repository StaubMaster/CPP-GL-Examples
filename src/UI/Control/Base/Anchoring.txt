	|-----------------------------------|	ParentSize
------------|								BoxMin
----------------------------|				BoxMax

this is all the stuff for Anchoring
dont store everything
most of these can be calculated

what is needed ?
BoxMin and BoxMax are what is used for actual Drawing
MinDist MaxDist and Size and Normal Center are currently used for
Anchoring calculations

MinDist and MinDist + Size are used for placing thinds
these also have Padded versions ?





MinDist and MaxDist is relative ?
Size is Absolute ?

this stuff is used to calculate AnchorBox
which is Absolute



Anchor Min
	keep MinDist and Size the same
	change MaxDist as needed

Anchor Max
	keep MaxDist and Size the same
	change MinDist as needed

Anchor Both
	keep MinDist and MaxDist the same
	change Size as needed



setting MinDist(val)
{
	ParentSize = MinDist + Size + MaxDist
	if Anchor Min
	{
		MinDist = val
		MaxDist = ParentSize - (val + Size)
	}
	if Anchor Max
	{
		undefined ?
	}
	if Anchor Both
	{
		MinDist = val
		Size = ParentSize - (val + MaxDist)
	}
}



Usage:

control0.anchor = min
control0.MinDist_Padded = 0
control0.Size = 50

control1.anchor = min
control1.MinDist_Padded = control0.MinDistMax_Padded
control1.Size = 50

control2.anchor = max
control2.MaxDist_Padded = 0
control2.Size = 50

control3.anchor = both
control3.MinDist_Padded = control1.MaxDist_Padded
control3.MaxDist_Padded = control2.MinDist_Padded



should this stuff care about being Absolute  (what?)

just have GetMin() and GetMax()
GetMin()
{
	if Anchor == NONE
	if Anchor == MIN	{ return MinDist }
	if Anchor == MAX	{ return MinDist + Size }
	if Anchor == BOTH	{ return MinDist }
}
so Relative to what the Anchor is

SetMin(val)
{
	if Anchor == NONE
	if Anchor == MIN
	if Anchor == MAX
	if Anchor == BOTH
}



how does C# do it ?
the absolute stuff is specified
so Position and Size
the Distance stuff is handled internally



do things need to be calculated whenever a variable is changed ?
no ?
the relevant ones get set, the others dont matter
unless the Anchor changes suddenly
which I currently dont do

should the data be the padded ?
and then the actual AnchorBox is inside that box ?
