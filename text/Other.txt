right now it is "recursive"

make it so only the last one, where the .exe is made
in this case the Examples
have a folder for "other"

and it downloads all the git stuff

then the Engine just looks for the FileManager
in the same folder as itself

or maybe have en Environment Variable for where it finds this stuff
but then that wouldnt work on thers peoples PCs
