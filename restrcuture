UserInterface has a lot of files

Spline also has a few files

Light could also be split into multiple files

Basic and Multi are single files

having everything in one directory is unorganized

put UI into seperate file

have UI Makefile and main in a directory
have Source Files in seperate directory ?
since that stuff might be used somewhere else as well ?

keep Basic and Multi together ?
